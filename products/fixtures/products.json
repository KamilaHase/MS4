It provides the necessary nutrients that protect it from drying out and premature aging. It has a wide range of uses, it can be used for make-up removal, aromatherapy, relaxation massage or fragrant bath. Rose oil is produced by the traditional method of gradual maceration, in which the buds of a rare damask rose (rosa damascena) are loaded into a mixture of cold-pressed oils for several weeks. This high-quality blend consists of organic sunflower, jojoba and argan oil. During this time, valuable properties and the intoxicating scent of roses, which is cultivated by the unspoiled nature of the Bulgarian and Moroccan mountains, pass into the macerate. Thanks to its 100% pure and natural origin, the pink macerate ensures a radiant and fresh appearance to the skin. Usage: Rose oil is best absorbed after the bath, when it is rubbed into the moist skin of the whole body with the help of circular movements. Also try the oil during a relaxing massage. Once absorbed, your skin will be pleasantly supple. If you suffer from dry hands or feet, use the oil as a nourishing and moisturizing cream.",
