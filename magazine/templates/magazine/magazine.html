                Bathing has been a part of the human health for centuries. 
                From the Roman people who loved a good bath to Scandinavians 
                who take plunges in cold water right after a sauna, each country 
                and continent seem to have their own traditions regarding bathing.
                Baths are relaxing. This is, while perhaps not a universal truth, at least a decidedly uncontroversial opinion to have. 
                And while research on bathing isnâ€™t the booming field of study it deserves to be, the data we do have supports their stress-relieving powers. 
                People who regularly take baths seem to have lower stress levels and be less depressed than people who just shower.
                Submerging yourself in water on the regular may even help make you less angry.
