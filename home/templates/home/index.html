      <h3 class="mb-3">Virgin Oils</h3>
      <p>Virgin oils are oils obtained by slow cold pressing (up to 40 Â° C) - from seeds, kernels, seed sprouts, or plant fruits, including herbs.. 
        The highest quality is those that are pressed from quality crops in a protective atmosphere and in the dark so as to maintain the highest possible efficiency. 
        The concentration of active substances in these oils is many times higher than in various macerates or leached solutions from herbs (teas). 
        Virgin oils contain high amount of omega 3, omega 6 and omega 9 unsaturated fatty acids, which the body cannot produce on its own, they are very good for maintaining and improving metabolism.
        They are intended for use directly with a spoon, for cold cuisine for preparation of vegetable salads, spreads, marinades, or for flavoring ready meals. 
        Some of the virgin oils can also be used for frying and cooking, such as olive oil, avocado oil, palm or coconut oil. 
        Many of them are used to a greater or lesser extent for cosmetic purposes (for skin, hair, body massages ...)
