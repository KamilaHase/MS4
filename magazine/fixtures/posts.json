            "author": "Dasha",
            "intro_text": "Obtained by a mechanical process from the white pulp of ripe coconuts. Virgin oil must be made from fresh crude flesh. It is carved out of the broken coconuts with a special scraper and thick milk is squeezed out of it.",
            "article": "Various methods can be used to separate the oil from the milk. The highest quality oil is provided by the centrifugal centrifugation method. The resulting oil has a pleasant aroma and taste with subtle tones of coconut and at a temperature above 25 ° C it turns into a clear liquid. Because this oil is not heat-treated during production, it retains all the nutritional value.*Over the past decades, the general public has been deceived by the massive propaganda of the soybean industry, which has labeled tropical oils as unhealthy. They reportedly increase blood cholesterol and cause coronary problems (because it is 'saturated' fat). The world's producers of soybean oil and other cheap fats were aware of the value of coconut oil and its benefits for human health. The problem was that coconuts could not grow so easily. such as soybean or rapeseed, so there was a need to publicly discredit competing coconut oil.*Coconut oil is unique in the vegetable kingdom in that it is composed of saturated fatty acids, similar to lard. That's why it was easy to call him unhealthy. Today, there are hundreds of studies that confirm the exact opposite. Coconut oil is a great gift of tropical nature to the people!*FATS ARE NOT ALL THE SAME*Coconut oil naturally does not contain cholesterol - it is a vegetable oil. In addition, thanks to its ability to stimulate the secretion of hormones by the thyroid gland, cholesterol in the body helps to break down. The relevant hormones convert cholesterol into an important sterol - progesterone. It slows down the signs of aging.*Thanks to its composition of saturated fatty acids, coconut oil is very resistant to yellowing - oxidation. This is a major weakness of vegetable oils, which have recently been massively recommended as healthy. This is true when it comes to fresh, cold pressed oils from vegetable seeds or olives. However, what most people will no longer learn is that valuable unsaturated fatty acids are very willing to react with atmospheric oxygen to form free radicals. This process accelerates temperature (refined oils, frying) and light. Even more dangerous is the process of hardening vegetable oils - hydrogenation. It produces highly toxic trans-fatty acids (TFA). It is these yellowed oils that contribute to clogged arteries and cause coronary heart disease. The body finds it very difficult to get rid of them. Artery deposits are made up of about 75% yellowish unsaturated vegetable fats, the rest is mostly cholesterol from the animal diet. TFAs are already considered so toxic that in the US, the TMK content will be mandatory on product packaging from 2006. Unlike other vegetable oils, coconut oil is stable even at high temperatures (it is saturated oil). It is therefore also very suitable for frying and baking. Where the aroma of virgin coconut oil is undesirable, refined but uncured coconut oil is used. RBD - reffined, bleached, deodorized /.*AGAINST BACTERIA AND PARASITES*Coconut oil is composed of the following fatty acids:*- lauric acid*- capric acid*- caprylic acid*- myristic acid*All these acids act against viruses, microbes, fungi and yeasts. Lauric acid has the strongest anti-viral effect, k. Caprylic is highly effective against yeast. MCFAs have the specific ability to disrupt the membranes of viruses, bacteria, yeasts and fungi. They are then easily neutralized by white blood cells. Thousands of patients with various infections, candida, herpes, etc. have been convinced of this property of coconut oil and its fractions. In many cases, it is advisable to apply coconut oil as an ointment to the affected areas.*One of the things you will notice when using coconut oil is that you will then stay longer without feeling hungry. The metabolism of the oil is similar to that of carbohydrates, but the breakdown into glucose is slower. There is no sudden flushing of sugar into the blood and its subsequent rapid decline. This is the case with the consumption of starches, sugars and large amounts of fruit. This fluctuation overloads the adrenal glands (when the blood sugar drops, hormones are flushed out, signaling that the body needs more food). Consumption of coconut oil therefore stabilizes blood sugar levels and reduces the burden on the adrenal glands. (Dark circles around the eyes are a sign of overloaded adrenal glands).*COCONUT OIL AND WEIGHT*Virgin coconut oil (PKO) is widely used as a dietary supplement to reduce body weight. While it seems incredible that fat helps lose weight, the experiences are evident. One of the big problems with weight loss is the JO-JO effect. Statistics are relentless, most of those who manage to lose weight regain their weight, and more. Many people are able to diet for a while, but over time they lose stamina. However, their body has meanwhile become accustomed to 'handling the food' with a limited supply of food, and then it is able to store even more fat in the supply from the same food supply. Fat plays an important role in nutrition, the body needs it for its work and knows it well, and what's more, fats make food enjoyment complete, enhance appetite and, most importantly, evoke a feeling of true satiety.*A much more effective way to reduce weight is to slow and permanently change your diet and lifestyle. Coconut oil can be of great benefit if we replace some of the fats in the diet. As we have already mentioned, it provides a longer feeling of satiety (a few teaspoons of oil can suppress hunger for several hours). It also has less energy value than other fats. Its digestion also takes place differently. PKO stimulates the body's metabolism to 'higher speed' and thus helps burn much more energy. Last but not least, it restores the proper function of the thyroid gland, whose hormones are essential for a balanced metabolism. vegetable fats during cooking.*SKIN CARE *Pure coconut oil is very easy to like as body lotion or skin oil. It spreads and absorbs well, smells very pleasant and has a beneficial effect on the skin. It has been used in this way for thousands of years in the tropics. It is especially suitable for dry and damaged skin. Its composition is close to fat in our skin and is therefore easily absorbed and absorbed by the body. Cosmetic companies very often use coconut oil or its fractions in their products. Thanks to its delicate scent, it is an ideal massage oil and lubricating oil / if you do not use a condom, fats damage the latex /.",

NUT SPREADS MADE FROM SIMPLE INGREDIENTS You will find an almost inexhaustible number of nut products on the market.

However, it can be easily stuffed into them, such as sugar, palm oil, stabilizers, flavorings and various substances. We have been producing nut spreads for 5 years and their popularity is huge. But learning the ideal production process was not easy. 'In the beginning, we bought a machine that didn't work at all. He overheated and destroyed the nuts. We realized that production must run at a lower speed,' outlines Carolin Nutty, a nut spread expert. Another machine was already creating the right consistency, but the spreads were still not ideal. So we kept looking and found inspiration in the production of chocolate, where cocoa beans are processed with granite stones and achieve a velvety soft result. So we bought another machine and really! Perfectly fine nut spreads were created. And how to eat them? Maybe just on a spoon, they are literally addictive. Pleasantly special pancakes and porridge, or you can spread them on your favorite pastry. We enjoy dipping fresh and dried fruit the most. But they are also interesting for salty, such as steaks or as part of sauces. Do you like nut spreads? What is your favorite one?",

No matter which group you belong to, take a moment to read this article, which contains the basics that every user of natural oils should know.",
            "article": "Why are we proponents of oils? Common cosmetics are made from petroleum-derived mineral oils, they contain petrochemicals, propylene, benzene and other toxic, synthetic products. How important we are to what we give to our bodies is just as important to what we give to our bodies. The skin is the largest human organ and absorbs up to 60% of what we apply to it. *On the contrary, the basis of natural cosmetic products are cold-pressed natural oils from the rarest plants. Oils from herbs, flowers and fruits draw magical power. They are designed for different skin types and you can apply them to different skin problems. *A common concern about using oils is that the skin will be oily or clog pores. However, the opposite is true and skin oils are currently coming to the fore. Vegetable oils, thanks to their unique properties, harmonize the skin and restore its balance. They are made from natural ingredients. It is important, as already mentioned, to find the right one for your skin and apply it correctly. *Oil for oily skin? Yes! The reason for oily skin may be that it is not sufficiently hydrated or has a lack of linoleic acid in its sebum (its high content is, for example, in Grape Oil), and thus the skin may be prevented by higher sebum production. *Skin oils do not work as moisturizers. The oil dries independently. This brings us to the most important point - oils need to be applied to cleansed, WET skin. The oil applied together with the water locks in moisture and together forms an emulsion, which is absorbed similarly to a face cream. A great option is to use Hyaluronic serum instead of water, which is currently fulfilling the role of moisturizing. Tap the serum and massage in the oil until the serum is completely absorbed. Another option is to use the hydrate before applying the oil. *Massage wet skin with oil. He takes as much skin as he needs. Massage until the water / serum with oil soaks up. Wait about 10 minutes and you can (but do not have to) extract excess oil with a clean towel / napkin.",
